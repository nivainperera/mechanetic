        <h3>Twelve Apostles</h3>
        <p>
            The Twelve Apostles are a series of rock formations formed by the continual erosion of mainland limestone cliffs by the Southern Ocean's water and wind. Initially, they were known as Sow and Piglets. The Sow was Mutton Bird Island, and her Piglets were the Twelve Apostles.

    <section id="Great Ocean Road">
        <h3>Great Ocean Road</h3>
        <p>
            The Great Ocean Road was built in 1919 to provide road transit to the region and to provide jobs for hundreds of Australian soldiers returning from World War I. The route is named for Australian soldiers who died in World War I, and the Memorial Arch at the eastern end honours their sacrifice.

        <h3>Sydney Harbour Bridge</h3>
        <p>
            The construction of the Sydney Harbour Bridge began on July 28, 1923, and was finished eight years later with the help of 1,400 employees. The construction employed over six million hand driven rivets, 53,000 tonnes of steel, and 272,000 gallons of paint.

        <h3>Sydney Opera House</h3>
        <p>
            In 1956, 233 designs were submitted for the worldwide design competition for the Sydney Opera House. Jørn Utzon of Denmark was named the winner, and he was awarded ₤5000 for his design.

    <section id="Bondi Beach">
        <h3>Bondi Beach</h3>
        <p>
            The name “Bondi” is derived from an Aboriginal phrase that means “water breaking over rocks” or “noise of water breaking over rocks”, respectively. However, a search of the Australian Museum yields another reference to the term “Bondi”. For them, it represents the location of a fight with “boondi” sticks. “Boondi” simply means “fighting sticks” in this context.

    <section id="Surfers Paradise">
        <h3>Surfers Paradise</h3>
        <p>
            Surfers, which is 83 kilometres from Brisbane, has a distinct place in the Gold Coast's iconography. The town and beach serve as a metaphor for the lifestyle and aspirations of the people who visit the area for vacation or to live. These people aren't merely visiting a sunny location for a vacation. They're on their way to a 'surfer's paradise.' It's a strong and evocative image.

    <section id="Great Barrier Reef">
        <h3>Great Barrier Reef</h3>
        <p>
            The Great Barrier Reef is the largest reef system in the world. The reef is vast, with about 3,000 distinct reefs, 900 islands, and a length of 2,600 kilometres. Even from space, this magnificent living system can be seen. The reef's thriving corals are now perched on old, decrepit structures. These ancient corals could be as old as 20 million years!
